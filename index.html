    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony (Primary Blue: #156CE0, Accent Orange: rgb(255, 140, 0), Grays: Tailwind defaults) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application uses a persistent sidebar for primary navigation, allowing users to select any module at any time. The main content area dynamically renders the details of the selected module, including key topics, lab information, and an interactive knowledge check section. A visual, timeline-style "Course Roadmap" is included at the top to provide a high-level overview of the learning path, which is also interactive. This structure was chosen to provide both a quick, high-level overview and deep-dive capability without leaving the page, enhancing user orientation and making the dense curriculum feel manageable and easy to explore. A new 'Course Overview' section has been added as the default landing page for a high-level understanding of the entire training. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Course structure of 13 modules. Goal: Organize/Show Progression. Viz/Method: Interactive HTML/CSS timeline diagram. Interaction: Clicking a module on the timeline navigates to its content. Justification: More engaging and informative than a static list, visually representing the learning journey.
        - Report Info: Module knowledge check questions. Goal: Inform/Self-Assess. Viz/Method: Interactive cards with a "Reveal Answer" button. Interaction: Click to show the correct answer. Justification: Encourages active recall and engagement over passive reading.
        - Report Info: Detailed comparisons (e.g., Storage types, Database types). Goal: Compare. Viz/Method: Styled HTML tables. Interaction: Row hover effects. Justification: Best method for direct feature-by-feature comparison.
        - New 'Course Overview' section: Goal: Provide high-level summary. Viz/Method: Formatted text with bullet points and bolding. Interaction: None, serves as an introductory overview.
        - All visual elements like icons and diagrams are built with HTML/Unicode and styled with Tailwind to adhere to constraints.

                            "Assuming a role" means that an IAM entity (an IAM User, another IAM Role, or a federated user) temporarily borrows the permissions of an IAM Role. This process is facilitated by the **AWS Security Token Service (STS)**.

                                <li>**Temporary Credentials**: When you assume a role, you get short-lived temporary credentials (typically valid for 15 minutes to 12 hours). If these credentials are compromised, their utility is limited by their short lifespan.</li>
                                <li>**No Credential Sharing**: You never need to share a static "admin" password or access key. Each user or service assumes the role using their own unique identity.</li>

                            The **aws configure** command is the entry point to setting up the AWS CLI's credential and configuration profiles. Its true power lies in managing multiple AWS identities and preferences.
                            <h5 class="font-semibold mt-3 mb-1 text-gray-800">Interactive Process:</h5>
                            <p>When you execute **aws configure** (or **aws configure --profile <profile-name>**), the CLI guides you through four essential inputs:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2">
                                <li>**AWS Access Key ID**: The public part of a programmatic credential (e.g., **AKIA...**). For enhanced security, best practice is to use temporary credentials from IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO) or an assumed role instead of long-lived IAM user access keys.</li>
                                <li>**AWS Secret Access Key**: The private, confidential part of the credential. It must be treated with the same level of confidentiality as a password and should never be hardcoded or committed to version control.</li>
                                <li>**Default Region Name**: The AWS Region (e.g., **eu-central-1**) that the CLI will use by default, avoiding the need to specify it with every command.</li>
                                <li>**Default Output Format**: Determines how the CLI formats API responses. Options include **json** (ideal for scripting), **text**, and **table** (for human readability).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h5 class="font-semibold mt-3 mb-1 text-gray-800">Configuration Files:</h5>
                            <p>The command stores information in two files within a **.aws** directory in the user's home folder:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2">
                                <li>**~/.aws/credentials**: Securely stores the **aws_access_key_id** and **aws_secret_access_key**. This file should have strict permissions (e.g., **chmod 600**) so only the owner can read it.</li>
                                <li>**~/.aws/config**: Stores the default region, output format, and definitions for named profiles.</li>

                            <p>For managing multiple accounts or roles, named profiles are essential. A new profile is created using the **--profile** flag (e.g., **aws configure --profile dev-account**). This creates a separate named section in the config and credentials files. To use a profile, either append **--profile <profile-name>** to a command or set the **AWS_PROFILE** environment variable.</p>

                                <li>**IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO) Integration**: Use **aws configure sso** to set up profiles that leverage short-lived, temporary credentials, which is the recommended best practice.</li>
                                <li>**Assuming IAM Roles**: Profiles can be configured in the **~/.aws/config** file to assume an IAM role, which is crucial for cross-account access and privilege separation. The CLI handles the **sts:AssumeRole** call automatically.</li>
                                <li>**EC2 Instance Profiles / ECS Task Roles**: For applications running on AWS compute services, attaching an IAM role directly to the resource is the most secure method. The AWS CLI and SDKs automatically retrieve temporary credentials from the instance metadata service, eliminating the need to store any credentials on the instance itself.</li>

                            AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) utilizes various policy types—JSON documents that define granular permissions—to control access to AWS resources.

                                <li>**Action**: Specific API operations (e.g., **ec2:RunInstances**).</li>
                                <li>**Resource**: The AWS resource targeted by the action, identified by its Amazon Resource Name (**ARN**).</li>

                                <li>**What it is**: A managed policy attached to an IAM user or role that defines the **maximum** permissions the identity can have.</li>
                                <li>**How it works**: It acts as a permanent "outer guardrail." The effective permissions are the intersection of the identity's policies and the boundary. It can only restrict permissions, not grant them. It is persisted with the IAM identity until explicitly detached.</li>
                                <li>**Primary Use Case**: Delegating administration with guardrails. A central security team can allow developers to create roles, but the boundary ensures those new roles can never exceed predefined permissions (e.g., preventing them from creating **iam:*** permissions). This is critical for preventing privilege escalation.</li>
                                <li>**Analogy**: A speed limiter permanently installed in a car. No matter how hard you press the gas (identity policy), you cannot exceed the limiter's maximum speed (boundary).</li>

                                <li>**How it works**: It acts as a **temporary** filter for a specific session only. The effective permissions are the intersection of the role's identity policies and the session policy. It is ephemeral and disappears when the session expires.</li>
                                <li>**Primary Use Cases**: Just-in-time least privilege. An admin can assume a role with a session policy that scopes down their broad permissions to only the specific actions and resources needed for a single task. It's also used heavily in attribute-based access control (ABAC) with federated users to dynamically generate policies based on user attributes.</li>

                            <p>Deploying a VPC's subnets across multiple Availability Zones is a fundamental best practice for achieving **high availability** and **fault tolerance**. Because each **AZ** is a physically isolated set of data centers, an issue affecting one AZ (like a power outage or network failure) will not impact resources in other AZs. By creating subnets in multiple AZs and deploying application resources (like **EC2 instances** or **RDS databases**) across them, you can build systems that remain operational even if one AZ becomes unavailable. Services like **Elastic Load Balancing** can then distribute traffic to the healthy resources in the remaining AZs, ensuring business continuity.</p>

                            <p>Managing network security in AWS involves a suite of specialized firewall services, each operating at different layers and offering distinct capabilities.</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2">
                                <li>**Amazon VPC Security Groups**: Act as a **stateful**, instance-level firewall (**Layer 4**) controlling inbound and outbound traffic for resources like **EC2 instances** and **RDS databases**. There is no additional charge for their use.</li>
                                <li>**Amazon VPC Network ACLs (NACLs)**: Act as a **stateless**, subnet-level firewall, providing an additional layer of defense by allowing or denying traffic based on rules that are processed in numerical order. There is no additional charge for their use.</li>
                                <li>**AWS Network Firewall**: A managed, **stateful firewall** and **intrusion prevention service (IPS)** that provides broad network protections for all VPCs. It inspects traffic at the packet level (**Layer 3/4**) and can filter both north-south (internet-facing) and east-west (inter-VPC) traffic. This is a paid, managed service.</li>
                                <li>**Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall**: Filters outbound DNS queries originating from within a VPC, helping to prevent resources from communicating with malicious domains. It operates at the **DNS layer** and can use AWS-managed domain lists.</li>
                                <li>**AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: Protects web applications and and **APIs** from common web exploits at the **application layer (Layer 7)**. It monitors **HTTP/S** requests and allows for highly customizable rules to block threats like **SQL injection** and **cross-site scripting**. It is a paid service with pricing based on rules and requests processed.</li>
                                <li>**AWS Firewall Manager**: A management service that simplifies the administration of various AWS protections (**WAF**, **Shield Advanced**, **Security Groups**, **Network Firewall**, **DNS Firewall**) across multiple accounts within an **AWS Organization**, ensuring consistent policy enforcement. This is a paid service.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="mt-2">It's also important to note that **AWS Shield Standard** provides automatic, no-cost **DDoS** protection for all customers at **Layers 3** and **4**.</p>

                                <li>**Core Concept**: Instead of relying solely on **CIDR blocks**, a security group rule can reference another security group as its source or destination. This allows traffic from any resource associated with the referenced security group.</li>
                                <li>**Benefits**:
                                    <ul class="list-circle pl-5 mt-1 space-y-1">
                                        <li>**Simplified Management**: Reduces administrative overhead. If the **IP addresses** of resources in the referenced group change (e.g., due to **auto-scaling**), you do not need to update the rules in the referring security group.</li>
                                        <li>**Dynamic Access**: The rules automatically adapt to changes in resource **IP addresses**.</li>
                                    </ul>

                            <p>In AWS networking, **Route Tables** and **Security Groups** are both fundamental components of **Amazon VPC**, but they operate at different layers and serve distinct purposes.</p>
                            <h6 class="font-semibold mt-2 mb-1 text-gray-800">Route Table (**Layer 3** - Network Layer)</h6>
                            <p>A **Route Table** contains a set of rules, called routes, that determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed. It operates at the **Network Layer (Layer 3)**, focusing on **IP addresses**.</p>

                                <li>**What it controls**: Packet forwarding, inter-subnet communication, and external communication to the internet, other **VPCs**, or on-premises networks.</li>
                                <li>**Key Characteristics**:
                                    <ul class="list-circle pl-5 mt-1 space-y-1">
                                        <li>**Scope**: Associated with subnets. Every subnet must be associated with one route table.</li>
                                        <li>**Rules (Routes)**: Each route specifies a destination **CIDR block** and a target (e.g., **Internet Gateway**, **NAT Gateway**).</li>
                                        <li>**Stateless**: It directs packets based on destination, without remembering past connections.</li>

                            <h6 class="font-semibold mt-2 mb-1 text-gray-800">Security Group (**Layer 4** - Transport Layer)</h6>
                            <p>A **Security Group** acts as a virtual **stateful firewall** for its associated resources (like **EC2 instances**). It operates at the **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**, focusing on protocols and port numbers.</p>

                                        <li>**Default Deny**: All inbound traffic is denied unless explicitly allowed by a rule.</li>
                                        <li>**Stateful**: If you allow inbound traffic, the corresponding outbound return traffic is automatically allowed, regardless of outbound rules.</li>
                                        <li>**Rules**: You define "**allow**" rules based on protocol, port range, and source/destination (**IP CIDR** or another security group).</li>

                                <li>**Analogy**: A **Security Group** is like the doorman and security system for an individual house (**EC2 instance**). It checks everyone trying to enter or leave against a whitelist.</li>
